This is a small project created as part of the final projects of the Front End Libraries Certification (300 hours) of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). 

For this project I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 

By default it is set to a session llength of 25 minutes with a break of 5 minutes. 

You can set up the length of each session up to 60 minutes. The break length can also go up to 60 minutes.  

### Features

✔️  Use of React 

✔️  Audio notification when timer ends
